# STL Iterators

A generalization of pointer.
Central generic programming because they are interface between container and algorithm.

## How it work
- An implementation of Iterator pattern
- It provides access to the element store in the container without expose the underlying representation
- Iterator object encapsulate the internal structure of how the iteration work
- Use to walk over the range of object container

### Main features
- Has the ability to move to the next item in the range
- Has the ability to read/write to item its currently pointing to
