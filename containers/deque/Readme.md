# Deque Double end queue


 A deque (pronounced "deck") is a double-ended queue that grows and
 shrinks at both ends efficiently. Insertions and deletions can be
 made in the middle, but these are slower. They are another type of
 sequential container with their elements ordered following a trict
 linear sequence.

 ## Deques may be implemented by specific libraries in different ways,
 but in all cases they allow for the individual elements to be
 accessed through random access iterators, with storage always
 handled automatically (expanding and contracting as needed).

 Deque containers have the following properties:

 . Individual elements can be accessed by their position index.

 . Iteration over the elements can be performed in any order. 
 
 . Elements can be efficiently added and removed from any of its
   ends (either the beginning or the end of the sequence).
 
 Deques therefore provide a similar functionality to vectors, but
 with efficient insertion and deletion of elements at the beginning
 and end of the sequence. Unlike vectors, however, deques don't ave
 all elements in contiguous storage locations, thus eliminating the
 possibility of traversing the deque container with simple pointer
 arithmetic.

 ### Both vectors and deques provide a very similar interface and can e
 used for similar purposes, but internally both work in quite
 different ways: While vectors are very similar to a C-style array
 that grows by reallocating all of its elements in a unique block
 when its capacity is exhausted, the elements of a deques can be
 divided in several chunks of storage, with the class keeping all
 this information and providing uniform access to the elements.
 
 Deques are a more complex internally, but this generally allows
 them to grow more efficiently than vectors with their capacity
 managed automatically. This efficiency is especially noticeable in
 large sequences, because massive reallocations are avoided.
 
 ### The deque implementation in the C++ Standard Template Library take

 two template parameters:

 ```
 template <typename T, 
           typename Allocator = allocator<T>> 
 class deque;
 ```
 
 1. T: Datatype of the elements to be stored in the deque.
 
 2. Allocator: This is the allocator object used to define the
    storage allocation model. By default, the Allocator class
    template from <memory> for type T is used, which defines the
    simplest memory allocation model and is value-independent.

 ## All of the member function implemented in vector are also
 implemented in deque except for capacity() and reserve().  Also
 included are two new functions:
 
 void push_front(const T&)    adds an element to the front
 void pop_front()             removes the first element

 ### This example shows how to create a deque, add elements to it using
 an index, and then display those elements using an index. Here we
 process the deque as though it were any container, using its
 push_back function, but without using its iterator.


 * Efficiency of deque vs. vector:
 *
 * . When performing a large number of push_back() calls, use
 *   vector::reserve().
 * 
 * . When performing many de-allocations, deque takes longer to
 *   reclaim memory than vector since it is allocated using multiple
 *   "chunks."
 * 
 * . When using insert() or pop_front() with a deque is more efficient
 *   than vector.
 * 
 * . For element access, vector::at() or vector[] is better than
 *   deque's at() or deque[] methods.
 *
 * Here is another deque example that uses dequeâ€™s random access
 * iterators.
